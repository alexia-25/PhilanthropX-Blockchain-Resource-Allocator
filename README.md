# PhilanthropX - Blockchain Resource Allocation System

PhilanthropX is a decentralized resource allocation platform built on the Stacks blockchain. It facilitates secure, milestone-based asset transfers with built-in accountability, ensuring assets are allocated only when certain conditions (achievements) are met.

This contract provides a transparent and accountable system for both providers and beneficiaries to manage and validate the allocation of resources. It incorporates security measures to prevent misuse, anomaly detection, and a community-driven review process.

## Features
- **Milestone-Based Resource Allocation**: Resources are transferred progressively as beneficiaries complete pre-defined achievements.
- **Anomaly Detection & Fraud Prevention**: Anomalous activity is detected and flagged, with strict measures to protect both providers and beneficiaries.
- **Multi-Beneficiary Allocations**: Supports proportional distribution of resources to multiple beneficiaries with customizable percentages.
- **Community Oversight**: A built-in review process allows the community to verify allocations and ensure fairness.
- **Delegation & Control**: Allocation control can be delegated to third parties with defined roles and permissions.
- **Emergency Recovery**: Provides a mechanism for the provider or overseer to request emergency recovery for any invalid or disputed allocations.

## Contract Details
- Built on the **Stacks Blockchain** using **Clarity 2.0**.
- Includes mechanisms for allocation creation, verification, and extension.
- Provides tools for delegation of authority over allocations and milestones.

## How to Use

### 1. Initiate an Allocation
To start a new resource allocation, the provider specifies the beneficiary, the total quantity of assets, and the achievements required to unlock the transfer.

```clarity
(initiate-allocation beneficiary principal, quantity uint, achievements list uint)
```

### 2. Validate Achievements
Once the beneficiary completes certain milestones, the overseer can validate the achievement, releasing the corresponding portion of assets.

```clarity
(validate-achievement allocation-id uint)
```

### 3. Terminate or Extend Allocations
Allocations can be terminated early by the provider or extended if necessary.

```clarity
(terminate-allocation allocation-id uint)
(extend-allocation-timeframe allocation-id uint, extension-time uint)
```

### 4. Multi-Beneficiary Allocations
You can also allocate resources to multiple beneficiaries with specific percentage splits.

```clarity
(create-proportional-allocation recipients list { beneficiary principal, percentage uint }, quantity uint)
```

### 5. Fraud Protection and Anomaly Detection
The system includes built-in anomaly detection, and any suspicious activity is flagged for further review.

## Security Features
- **Access Control**: Only authorized parties can perform specific actions, ensuring no unauthorized modifications.
- **Protection from Anomalous Activities**: Multiple checks are in place to prevent fraud, such as rapid repeated transfers or unusually large allocations.
- **Community Reviews**: Every allocation can be reviewed by the community to ensure fairness and transparency.
